# StudyScript
Turns CSV Files into usable flash cards. A README is available with more information

In order to use this script properly, you need a CSV File (edited from google sheets or excel, or any other editor of your choice) with two columns set up. Column A is used as questions and Column B is used as the answers to those questions. It can be as long as you want it to be. Once set up, you can either run the program with the argument being the CSV file, or you can place it into a database folder, which will prompt you to choose which CSV File you want ot use.
